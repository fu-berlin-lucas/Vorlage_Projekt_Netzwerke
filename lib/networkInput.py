## Idea:
## Load json file here and create dataframes or similar data structures
## Data frames can than be processed in network creation
## Must not follow this exact structure, but the network creation and loading the data should be separated

class NetworkInput:
    def __init__(self):
        print('TBD')

    def get_XYZ(self):
        return 0
    
    def load_data_from_txt_file(self, data_path_and_name):
        print('TBD')
